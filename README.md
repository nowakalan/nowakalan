### Hi there 👋

✨ About me

🎓 Currently, I'm at the end of one-year Full Stack Developer programming course run by the Codecool programming school, where I worked on my tech and soft skills.

🔎 I am looking for a job as a junior engineer with the possibility of development and the chance to learn even more new things! :)

📁 I am an open, sociable, active and most of all helpful person. I love to make new friends, gain new experiences and cannot imagine life without people around me. I am ready for new challenges, even if the road is rough, I will try even harder.

💪 Beside that i am trying to develop my mind i am sport enthusiast especially calisthenics. Sometimes I help my friends with planning their diets to lose weight or build muscles. Remember! In a healthy body, healthy mind. 😎

🎮📚 I love reading books and playing video games. Well when it comes to books i will choose those about personal development or thriller ones. Currently reading Thinking, Fast and Slow by Kahneman Daniel and my favorite thriller is I Am Pilgrim by Terry Hayes. Regarding to playing games i would choose online games and skilled ones.
