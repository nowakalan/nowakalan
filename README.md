### Hi, I'm Alan! 👋

✨ About me

🎓 Currently, I'm at the end of **Java from Scratch** [(diplom)](https://app.diplomasafe.com/en-US/diploma/dc9dadebbb13afe2f28351b8c6dcf1ad81463493a) and **UX/UI Design** courses run by the Software Development Academy programming school, where I worked on my tech and soft skills.

🔎 I am looking for a job as a junior engineer with the possibility of development and the chance to learn even more new things! :)

📁 I am an open, sociable, active, and, most importantly, helpful person. I love making new friends and gaining new experiences. I am ready for new challenges, and even if the road is rough, I will try even harder.

💪 Besides that, I am trying to develop my mind. I am a sports enthusiast, especially in roller skating, and recently, I have taken up gym workouts. I believe that a healthy body is crucial for a healthy mind. 😎
